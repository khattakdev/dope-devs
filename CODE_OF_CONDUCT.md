# Dope Devs Community Code of Conduct

Welcome to Dope Devs, a community of enthusiastic and respectful web developers! Our mission is to create an inclusive and supportive space for developers from all walks of life. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for all those who participate in our community and ensures a safe environment for everyone.

## 1. Respect and Inclusivity:

We welcome and support people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes but is not limited to members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

## 2. Harassment-Free Experience:

We will not tolerate harassment of community members in any form, including but not limited to harassment based on gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion.

## 3. Professional Conduct:

Maintain a professional and respectful tone during all interactions. Disagreements are natural, but should be resolved courteously and professionally.

## 4. No Tolerance for Discrimination or Hate Speech:

Discriminatory jokes, language, and any form of hate speech are not allowed in our community. Members engaging in discriminatory behavior will face strict action, including potential banning from the community.

## 5. Reporting and Enforcement:

If you are subject to or witness any violations of this Code of Conduct, please report them to hey@devsdope.com. All reports will be reviewed and investigated, and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances.
We will prioritize marginalized people’s safety over privileged people’s comfort. The community organizers will not act on complaints regarding:
‘Reverse’ -isms, including ‘reverse racism,’ ‘reverse sexism,’ and ‘cisphobia’.
Reasonable communication of boundaries, such as “leave me alone,” “go away,” or “I’m not discussing this with you.”

## 6. Encouragement and Growth:

We encourage members to provide constructive feedback and to foster discussions that help individuals and the community grow. We seek to build a community where all members feel comfortable and empowered to share their experiences and knowledge.
This Code of Conduct applies to all community spaces, both online and off. Anyone who violates this Code of Conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Dope Devs community organizers.

Thank you for helping make Dope Devs a welcoming, respectful, and inclusive community for all developers.
